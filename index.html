                Emot.io is a thought-provoking New Media Performance that
                explores the relationship between pain and pleasure. With this
                performance, the boundaries between pain and pleasure are
                tested. Pain is the limit between what's alive and what is not,
                pleasure its an instant satisfaction that can be experienced in
                different ways. Both of this feelings are common between human,
                animals and nature. But is it possible for a machine to feel
                pain or pleasure? How does a machine understand this emotional
                and physical states?

                Lina Orejuela is a 27 year old New Media Artist from Bogotá,
                Colombia currently based in Berlin. As an artist she is
                interested in exploring the bodies that are formulated in the
                contemporary world. Her work is build upon concepts such as the
                post-humanism, trans-humanism and cyborg. These three notions
                formulate the main topics in her work: what is life? what are
                the boundaries between life and dead? How can other forms of
                life and other bodily conformations exist? What are the limits
                between organic and inorganic, human and non-human? Her practice
                is an overlap between art, science and technology.
